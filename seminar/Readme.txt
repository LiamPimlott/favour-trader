Acceptance Testing

How to configure ??
We will use codeceptjs because its easy and fun

0) Requirements
	-Latest node js should be installed on machine
1) npm install -g codeceptjs-nightmare (nightmare run tests faster because it doesnot require selenium server and real browser)
2) codeceptjs init
3) set up directories as you wish


writing tests
to create tests: codeceptjs gt
to run tests: codeceptjs run --steps


wasn't that hard right ?
